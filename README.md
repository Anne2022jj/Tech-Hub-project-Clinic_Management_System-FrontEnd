# Frontend Implementation Guide – Clinic App (React + TypeScript + MUI)

This guide outlines a 3-week development plan for building the frontend of the Clinic App, based on the architecture used in [typescript-task](https://github.com/OmarIhsan/typescript-task). It assumes a team of two frontend developers working alongside backend teammates.

---

## Week 1: Project Setup & Core Scaffolding

**Goal**: Establish the foundation using your modular architecture.

### Setup & Configuration

- Clone boilerplate from `typescript-task` and rename to `clinic-app`
- Install dependencies:
  - `@mui/material`, `@mui/icons-material`
  - `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `react-query`, `zod`, `react-hook-form`
- Configure:
  - `vite.config.ts` or `tsconfig.json` for path aliases (`@features`, `@components`, `@services`, etc.)
  - `theme.ts` inside `@/theme` for MUI customization

### Folder Structure

```
src/
  ├── features/         # Screens and domain logic
  ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
  ├── services/         # API layer
  ├── types/            # Shared types/interfaces
  ├── hooks/            # Custom hooks
  ├── theme/            # MUI theme config
  └── router/           # Route definitions
```

### Initial Modules

- `features/auth`: Login page, token handling
- `features/patients`: List + Create/Edit form
- `features/doctors`: List + Create/Edit form
- `services/api.ts`: Axios instance with interceptors
- `types/index.ts`: Shared interfaces (Patient, Doctor, Appointment, etc.)

---

## Week 2: CRUD Screens & API Integration

**Goal**: Build core screens and connect to backend using your `services` layer.

### Entity Modules

- `features/appointments`: List, filter by doctor/status, create form
- `features/treatmentPlans`: Form with dynamic steps, status control
- `features/medicalRecords`: Diagnosis + findings + treatment
- `features/procedures`: Linked to treatment plans

### Component Development

- `components/FormInput`, `SelectField`, `DatePicker`, `FileUpload`
- `components/TableView`: Reusable table with pagination
- `components/StatusBadge`: For appointment/treatment status

### API Layer

- `services/patientService.ts`, `doctorService.ts`, etc.
- Use `react-query` for caching, loading, and error states
- Define DTOs and validation schemas with `zod`

### UX Patterns

- Skeleton loaders, toast notifications, error alerts
- Form validation with `react-hook-form` + `zod`
- Role-based access wrappers (if needed)

---

## Week 3: Polish, Dashboard, and QA

**Goal**: Finalize UX, add dashboard, and prepare for handoff.

### Dashboard Module

- `features/dashboard`: Total patients, upcoming appointments, active plans
- Use MUI `Card`, `Grid`, and `Typography` for layout
- Optional: Add charts with `recharts`

### File Uploads

- `features/clinicalDocuments`: Upload + preview
- Drag-and-drop with MUI + file type validation

### QA & Testing

- Write unit tests for `components/` using `vitest` or `jest`
- Manual test flows: login → create patient → schedule appointment → add treatment plan → upload document

### Documentation & Handoff

- Create `README.md` with setup, folder structure, and dev guide
- Document API endpoints and screen responsibilities
- Optional: Record Loom walkthrough for future devs

This guide is designed to help your team move fast while maintaining clarity, modularity, and production-readiness.
